# Steganography Project

## Overview
This project implements **Steganography**, the art and science of hiding information within other non-secret data, such as images, audio, or video files. The goal is to securely embed secret messages in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye or ear.

## Features
- Hide text messages inside images without noticeable changes.
- Extract hidden messages from steganographic images.
- Support for multiple image formats (e.g., PNG, BMP).
- User-friendly command-line interface (or GUI if applicable).
- Optional encryption for added security.

## How It Works
The project uses techniques such as Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation to embed secret data into the pixels of an image. This method modifies the least significant bits of pixel values, which does not significantly affect the image's appearance.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
